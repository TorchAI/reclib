    An ``Instance`` is a collection of :class:`~reclib.data.fields.field.Field` objects,
    specifying the inputs and outputs to some model.
    We don't make a distinction between inputs and outputs here, though - all
    operations are done on all fields, and when we return arrays, we return them as dictionaries
    keyed by field name.  A model can then decide which fields it wants to use as inputs as which
    as outputs.

    fields : ``Dict[str, Field]``
        The ``Field`` objects that will be used to produce data arrays for this instance.
